Analytics](https://www.coindesk.com/author/coindesk-analytics)\n\nUpdated Nov 8, 2025, 4:40 a.m. Published Nov 8, 2025, 4:39 a.m. \n\n![Image 46: A trader sists in front on screens. (sergeitokmakov/Pixabay)](https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F67b408afc5cf05bd9c66f09347ac62ae97f497ec-1080x1080.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)\n\n#### What to know:\n\n*   XRP surged 3.6% to $2.31, breaking key resistance at $2.28, driven by ETF momentum and network growth.\n*   Canary Capital Group\'s amended prospectus for its proposed XRP ETF moves closer to potential SEC approval.\n*   XRP\'s price action shows strong institutional interest, with significant volume increases and new wallet creations.\n\nXRP climbed 3.6% to $2.31 in Saturday trading, breaking above key resistance at $2.28 as ETF momentum and network growth drove renewed institutional interest. Volume surged 86% above the 24-hour average during the breakout, lifting the token to its strongest close in over a week while outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum amid subdued broader market activity.\n\n### **News Background**\n\n*   Canary Capital Group filed an amended prospectus for its proposed Canary XRP ETF, moving the fund closer to potential SEC approval under Section 8(a).\n*   The ETF would trade on Nasdaq under ticker XRPC and hold XRP in custody with Gemini Trust Company and BitGo Trust Company, using the CoinDesk XRP CCIXber 60m New York Rate as its pricing benchmark.\n*   The filing follows a parallel move by 21Shares, which triggered an automatic-effectiveness countdown for its own spot XRP ETF. \n*   Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas noted that dual filings could force the SEC’s first decision on XRP-based ETFs, echoing precedents set by approved Bitcoin and Ether products. \n*   The filings add to a week of expanding institutional focus on Ripple, which also announced new partnerships with Mastercard and WebBank for RLUSD settlement.\n\n### **Price Action Summary**\n\n*   XRP traded within a $0.19 range, gaining strength after clearing resistance at $2.22 and $2.28 in a single high-volume move at 16:00 UTC. \n*   The breakout occurred on 165M volume, marking an 86% jump over daily averages and confirming institutional participation.\n*   Price action consolidated between $2.32–$2.35, holding higher lows and signaling controlled accumulation by larger traders. \n*   Hourly charts showed repeated defenses at $2.309–$2.310, where buyers absorbed every dip, while brief volatility spikes to $2.324 indicated strong order-book liquidity at new support levels.\n\n### **Technical Analysis**\n\n*   The breakout above $2.28 confirmed the end of short-term compression, with RSI turning upward and MACD crossing into positive territory. The higher-low structure established a bullish channel with immediate resistance at $2.35–$2.40.\n*   On-chain data supported the move, showing 21,595 new XRP wallets created within 48 hours — the largest increase in eight months — alongside mixed whale behavior. \n*   Roughly 900,000 XRP were transferred to exchanges over five days, suggesting potential short-term supply pressure, though net exchange reserves remain historically low.\n*   Volume divergence between the breakout and subsequent consolidation implies institutional repositioning rather than speculative momentum, keeping bias moderately bullish above $2.27.\n\n### **What Traders Should Know**\n\n*   XRP’s ability to hold above $2.30 will determine whether the current breakout evolves into a sustained leg higher. \n*   A confirmed close above $2.35 could extend the move toward $2.54–$2.80, while failure below $2.27 risks retesting the $2.13–$2.15 zone.\n*   Traders continue to monitor ETF progress as a near-term volatility trigger. If Canary’s registration passes automatically under 8(a) rules, XRP could become the next major asset with U.S.-listed spot exposure — a development that may accelerate institutional demand and price discovery heading into Q4.\n\n[XRP](https://www.coindesk.com/tag/xrp)\n\nMore For You\n\nInside Zcash: Encrypted Money at Planetary Scale\n\nBy[CoinDesk

deep dive into Zcash\'s zero-knowledge architecture, shielded transaction growth, and its path to becoming encrypted Bitcoin at scale.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nIn 2025, Zcash evolved from niche privacy tech into a functioning encrypted-money network:\n\n*   **Shielded adoption surged**, with 20–25% of circulating ZEC now held in encrypted addresses and 30% of transactions involving the shielded pool.\n*   **The Zashi wallet** made shielded transfers the default, pushing privacy from optional to standard practice.\n*   **Project Tachyon**, led by Sean Bowe, aims to boost throughput to thousands of private transactions per second.\n*   **Zcash surpassed Monero** in market share, becoming the largest privacy-focused cryptocurrency by capitalization.\n\n[View Full

Malwa](https://www.coindesk.com/author/shaurya-malwa), [CD Analytics](https://www.coindesk.com/author/coindesk-analytics)\n\n1 hour ago\n\n![Image 49: (CoinDesk

move created a lower high formation that signals a potential short-term shift in momentum.\n\nWhat to know:\n\n*   Dogecoin surged above key resistance levels before a late-session reversal erased most gains.\n*   Trading volume spiked 96% above average, driven by speculative interest and whale accumulation.\n*   The market\'s inability to maintain breakout levels suggests short-term liquidity rather than sustained growth.\n\n[Read full story](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/11/11/doge-tests-usd0-18-floor-after-intraday-breakout-sparks-profit-taking)\n\n[Latest Crypto
